# ExpenseTracker

How to run:

1. Download ExpenseTracker.

2. If you haven't already, download and install xampp: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html

3. Find where xampp is installed and open the 'xampp' folder.

4. Open the 'htdocs' folder and unzip ExpenseTracker in that folder.

5. Go back to the 'xampp' folder and scroll down and open the 'xampp-control' application.

6. Press the start button beside the apache module.

7. In the url of your web browser, type 'localhost/ExpenseTracker/www/index.html'.

Troubleshooting tips: 

Make sure that the index.html file path is '/xampp/htdocs/ExpenseTracker/www'. If it isn't there, then your localhost is looking in the wrong spot and won't be able to open it.

In the xampp control panel, make sure 'Apache' is highlighted green. If it isn't then localhost will refuse to connect.
